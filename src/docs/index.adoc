== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Blog Services Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing blogs in {gr8crm} applications. A blog post is just a HTML document
with some extra properties. You could probably use the http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-content/[crm-content] plugin
to write blog posts and publish on a web page but the +crm-blog+ plugin together with +crm-blog-ui+ makes blog authoring much easier.

The +crm-blog+ plugin does not duplicate code or features in +crm-content+ plugin.
Instead it depends on +crm-content+ and delegate much of the storage and rendering to +crm-content+.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-blog-ui/[crm-blog-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for blog authors.
