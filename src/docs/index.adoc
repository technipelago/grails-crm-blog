== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Blog Services Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing blogs in {gr8crm} applications. A blog post is just a HTML document
with some extra properties. You could probably use the http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-content/[crm-content] plugin
to write blog posts and publish on a web page but the +crm-blog+ plugin together with +crm-blog-ui+ makes blog authoring much easier.

The +crm-blog+ plugin does not duplicate code or features in +crm-content+ plugin.
Instead it depends on +crm-content+ and delegate much of the storage and rendering to +crm-content+.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-blog-ui/[crm-blog-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for blog authors.

=== Rendering blog posts

To render blog posts in a GSP page you can use the *crm:blogPosts* tag.
It iterates over all published blog posts and render it's content on the page.
The following example show that:

[source,html]
.blog/index.gsp
----
<crm:blogPosts var="post" query="${[status: 'published']}" params="${[max: 20, sort: 'date', order: 'desc']}">
    <div class="crm-blog-post" id="${post.name}">
        <g:link action="show" id="${post.name}"><h2>${post.title.encodeAsHTML()}</h2></g:link>

        <p class="lead">${post.description?.encodeAsHTML()}</p>

        <div>
            <span class="muted" style="font-size: 12px;">
                Published <g:formatDate format="d MMM yyyy" date="${post.date}"/>
            </span>
        </div>

        <div class="crm-blog-body">
            <crm:render template="${post.template}" parser="${post.parser}" model="${post}"/>
        </div>

        <p class="crm-blog-tags">
            <span class="muted">Tags:</span>
            <g:each in="${post.tags()}" var="tag">
                <span class="label label-info">${tag.encodeAsHTML()}</span>
            </g:each>
        </p>

        <hr/>
    </div>
</crm:blogPosts>
----

The example above render something like this:

image::blog-view.png[]

The *crm:blogPosts* tag is included in the *crm-blog* plugin so you could create a Grails application
that serves a public web site and include the crm-blog plugin to render blog posts.
Then you could create another Grails application and include the *crm-blog-ui* plugin to get all the blog editing
features that your blog authors use to create content.
Or you can include both plugins in the same application if it's a small project with limited requirements.

== Domain model

image:blog-domain.png[Blog domain model]

== CrmBlogService

The +CrmBlogService+ provide methods for creation and management of blog posts.

=== Create a new blog post

+CrmBlogPost createBlogPost(Map params, boolean save = false)+

    def published = crmBlogService.createBlogStatus(name: "Published", true)
    def post = crmBlogService.createBlogPost(status: published, name: "test",
            title: "Test post", description: "This is my first test", date: new Date(), true)

To create a new blog post you call +createBlogPost+ with a +Map+ of values. The +save+ parameter controls if
the blog post should be persisted immediately or just initialized with values.
This does only create the metadata for the blog post. The actual HTML content is created separately.

    crmContentService.createResource('<h1>TEST</h1><p>Hello World</p>', 'content.html', post, [contentType: 'text/html'])

You see that we leverage *crmContentService* from the *crm-content* plugin. That plugin is automatically included
by the *crm-blog* plugin with a compile-time dependency. So all features in *crm-content* are available when you
use the *crm-blog* plugin.

=== Retrieve a blog post

+CrmBlogPost getBlogPost(Long id)+

To retrieve a blog post by it's primary key you can use getBlogPost().

=== Search for blog posts

+def list(Map query, Map params)+

Query blog posts with the list() method.

The following key kan be used in the +query+ map.
Pagination and sorting keys goes into the +params+ map.

- title (wildcard)
- username
- status (wildcard)
- fromDate (date)
- toDate (date)

=== Archive an old blog post

+boolean archiveBlogPost(CrmBlogPost post)+

This method sets the status to *archived*. This is a special +CrmBlogStatus+ with the +param+ property set to *archived*.
You can change the parameter to something else with the configuration option +crm.blog.status.archived+.

=== Delete a blog post

+String deleteBlogPost(CrmBlogPost crmBlogPost)+

Deletes a blog post. The blog post +toString()+ value is returned after successful deletion.
